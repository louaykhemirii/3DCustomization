How It Works
1. Avatar Customization UI
The user interface for avatar customization is designed with a clean and intuitive layout. Players can navigate through different categories (e.g., shirts, shorts, hair) and select their preferred customization options.

Categories:
T-Shirts
Shorts
Hair Colors
Accessories (glasses, hats, etc.)
2. Animation Integration
The avatar will update its animations to reflect changes made in its appearance. For example:

The character’s movements are smooth and dynamic, ensuring proper transition between idle, walking, and running animations.
Accessories and hair color changes are maintained during animations.
3. Easy-to-Integrate Script
The project includes a series of scripts that handle customization changes. Each script is modular and designed for easy integration with other Unity components. For example:

AvatarCustomizationManager.cs: Manages all customization options.
AnimationController.cs: Handles character animations during and after customization.

Requirements
